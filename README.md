# pIRCe

Bringing the best and worst of the internet together.

This is a very extensible and customizable IRC bot framework for bring LLM powered chat/utility functions to IRC channels. However, it currently lacks an usable configuration interface, and is unlikely to get one soon, as it's more of a base for me to experiment with various LLM service APIs. Don't install this.
