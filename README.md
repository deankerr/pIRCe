# pIRCe

Bringing the best and worst of the internet together.

This is a very extensible and customizable IRC bot framework for bring LLM powered chat/utility functions to IRC channels. However, it currently lacks an usable configuration interface, and is unlikely to get one soon, as it's more of a base for me to experiment with various LLM service APIs. Don't install this.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
